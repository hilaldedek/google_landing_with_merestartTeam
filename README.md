# Google Landing with me_restart Team

- This project is the first project we have done as a group.
- In this project, we divided the Google Landing page into "header", "section" and "footer" and each sub-team of three people completed a part of the page.
- We used HTML and CSS while making this page.
- Here is the page we take as an example:  https://aaron-clarusway.github.io/google-landing--page/
